#  Recipe Solution

#### By Jackson Levine, Jake Maier, Vera Weikel 

#### This is a project to build Basic Web Application using ASP .Net, MVC, and EF Core databases.

## Technologies Used

* .Net 6 SDK
* C#
* EFCore
* ASP.Net MVC
* Razor
* Identity

## Goals/Objectives

This project shows how to connect an ASP.NET Core MVC project to a MySQL database using [Entity Framework Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/).

## Description

This project uses Identity in an ASP.NET Core MVC project to authenticate users. This project contains a one-to-many relationship between `Tag` and `Recipe` and a one-to-many relationship between `ApplicationUser` and `Recipe`. 

## How To Run This Project

If you have not already, install the `dotnet-ef` tool by running the following command in your terminal:

```
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef --version 6.0.0
```

### Set Up and Run Project

1. Clone this repo.
2. Open the terminal and navigate to this project's production directory called "ToDoList".
3. Within the production directory "ToDoList", create a new file called `appsettings.json`.
4. Within `appsettings.json`, put in the following code, replacing the `uid` and `pwd` values with your own username and password for MySQL. For the LearnHowToProgram.com lessons, we always assume the `uid` is `root` and the `pwd` is `epicodus`.

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=to_do_list_with_auth;uid=root;pwd=epicodus;"
  }
}
```

5. Create the database using the migrations in the To Do List project. Open your shell (e.g., Terminal or GitBash) to the production directory "ToDoList", and run `dotnet ef database update`. 
    - To optionally create a migration, run the command `dotnet ef migrations add MigrationName` where `MigrationName` is your custom name for the migration in UpperCamelCase. To learn more about migrations, visit the LHTP lesson [Code First Development and Migrations](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/c-and-net-part-time/many-to-many-relationships/code-first-development-and-migrations).
6. Within the production directory "ToDoList", run `dotnet watch run` in the command line to start the project in development mode with a watcher.
4. Open the browser to _https://localhost:5001_. If you cannot access localhost:5001 it is likely because you have not configured a .NET developer security certificate for HTTPS. To learn about this, review this lesson: [Redirecting to HTTPS and Issuing a Security Certificate](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/lessons/redirecting-to-https-and-issuing-a-security-certificate).

## Database Instructions 

* In your terminal type to create a db migration: $ dotnet ef migrations add Initial
* Updating the Database with the Migration: $ dotnet ef database update

## DB (Optional)

* If you would like to see a current view of the database: Open SQL workbench.
* Navigate to the "Administration" tab in SQL Workbench.
* Click "Schema" 
* Right hand mouse click "Refresh All".
* The _Name the schema "project_name" of the database in this current project will be in view

## Known Bugs

* None
